       "  'administrativeBackground': \"The Journal Office, headed by the Clerk of the Journals, is responsible for minuting the daily activities of the Chamber.  Many of the principal record series of the House of Commons arise from the work of this office.  The Clerk of the Journals reports to the Clerk of the House, who since the eighteenth century has delegated these matters to him or her.\\n\\nBusiness includes taking the minute of proceedings of the House, the overnight production of the 'Votes and Proceedings', compiling and publishing the resulting  Journal, and managing the presentation of printed and unprinted sessional papers presented to the Lords during sittings.   Questions of Parliamentary procedure and precedents  in the House of Commons also fall within the remit of the Clerk of the Journals, as does recording the oaths of MPs on their introduction to the House and at the start of each Parliament.  \\n\\nThe first Clerk of the Journals, Samuel Littlemore, was appointed in 1742, when he was known as the 'clerk of the Papers'.  The  history of the Journal Office before that time is unclear due to the absence of records as result of the 1834 fire, but it is clear that the Clerk of the House had at least copyists from the earliest times to help him compile the Journal from his manuscript minutes.\",\n",

       "  'custodialHistory': \"The Clerk was ordered to keep the Journals in his personal custody but the Journals for the sessions between 1584 and 1601 were lost at some time before 1660. Much of their contents, however, had been included by Sir Simonds D'Ewes in his 'Compleat Journal of the Votes, Speeches and Debates both of the House of Lords and House of Commons', subsequently published in 1682.\\nBy 1800 the Clerk of the Journals had in his custody, in his office abutting the upper wall of St Stephen's chapel, the journals, minutes from 1685 onwards, committee minutes from 1688, petitions, bills, reports, accounts and papers, arranged and bundled.  Those dating from 1770 were in 1800 in good order but the earlier records had apparently fallen into disarray.  There were also significant quantities of records stored in the 'lumber room' above the Chamber itself.   All these, save the manuscript Journals, were destroyed in fire of 1834 which burnt down the old Palace of Westminster.  The House's decision to print all Journals in 1742, and the fact that most laid  papers were printed from 1800, helped at least in part to ensure that the 'modern' losses of records (ie those from 1800)  were not as severe as they could have been.  Nevertheless this event remains one of the greatest archival disasters to befall the country in its history.\",\n",
